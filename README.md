# Applied Data Science Capstone  
This repository contains the project materials and submissions for the **[Applied Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone?specialization=ibm-data-science)**, the final course in the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** on Coursera. This capstone project allows learners to demonstrate their data science skills by solving a real-world problem.

## Course Overview  
The Applied Data Science Capstone provides hands-on experience in working with real-world data and applying data science methodologies. Participants will complete tasks such as data collection, wrangling, exploratory analysis, and the application of machine learning techniques.  

This project aims to simulate the end-to-end workflow of a data science project while focusing on creating actionable insights and delivering a final presentation.

## Tools and Technologies  
This project makes use of the following tools:  
- **Python** as the programming language  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for documentation and execution of code  
- **Key Libraries**:  
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data handling  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning  
  - `folium` for geospatial data visualization (if needed)  

## Project Outline  
1. **Problem Definition**  
   - Define the problem and its significance.  
   - Outline the project goals and objectives.  

2. **Data Collection**  
   - Identify data sources (e.g., APIs, datasets, web scraping).  
   - Collect, clean, and prepare the data for analysis.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summarize the data with descriptive statistics.  
   - Create visualizations to identify patterns and trends.  

4. **Model Development**  
   - Build machine learning models to predict outcomes or categorize data.  
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.  

5. **Results and Insights**  
   - Present findings with compelling visualizations.  
   - Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.  

6. **Report and Presentation**  
   - Prepare a detailed project report.  
   - Create a presentation summarizing the methodology, results, and insights.
